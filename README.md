# AllTheTime
Search for and sign up for courses, view your weekly schedule, and add notes for homework and exams.

## Project background
This iOS app accesses a mock API provided by Kakao's [Programmers] and was built as part of a couple-of-days challenge.

This was my first attempt at MVVM and was done without consulting any guides on the topic, nor are any reactive principles used.

The API backend may no longer be accessible. Also, the interface design, while built from scratch, imitates specifications provided by Programmers, so I claim no rights to the visual appearance.

## To do
This app was submitted in an incomplete state, and has not been further developed since. The calendar view is generated on application load and does not refresh when the user makes changes, or refreshes but breaks the view. Certain features like notes are also not fully implemented.
